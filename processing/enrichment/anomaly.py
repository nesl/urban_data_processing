"""Low-latency multimodal anomaly detection for incident sensing reports.

This module is designed to sit immediately before `observation_model.py`.
It emits candidate `observed_effects` and `possible_incidents` using the same
label style as the observation model, while keeping state for streaming
numeric sensors.

Typical usage from observation_model.py or a pipeline driver:

    from anomaly_detection import MultimodalAnomalyDetector

    detector = MultimodalAnomalyDetector(
        use_text_embeddings=True,
        use_image_clip=True,
        use_yolo=False,
        use_river=True,
    )

    anomaly = detector.detect_report(report)
    model_payload = anomaly.to_observation_model_payload(
        allowed_effects=allowed_effects,
        allowed_incidents=allowed_incidents,
    )

Optional dependencies:

    pip install numpy pandas rapidfuzz sentence-transformers pillow transformers torch river ultralytics

The module is deliberately dependency-tolerant: keyword/rule-based detection
and rolling robust time-series anomaly scoring work without the heavy optional
models. Embedding, CLIP, YOLO, and River are loaded lazily only when enabled.
