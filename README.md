# Urban Observation Processing

This repository replays stored real or synthetic data, converts it to the
`urban-observation.v1` format, receives it over TCP, and applies shared anomaly
gating, LLM/VLM enrichment, and geocoding.

It does not collect provider data and it does not generate synthetic data.

## How it fits together

On a storage machine, install this repository with `urban-observations` and run
the replay sender against collected files or TAR archives. On a compute machine,
run its receiver and enrichment containers beside SIGMUS or IncidentLens.

```text
stored real data ──┐
                   ├── replay ── TCP:8766 ──> receiver ── HTTP ──> enrichment
stored simulation ─┘                                      |
                                                         JSONL
                                                   SIGMUS / IncidentLens
```

The receiver and enrichment service normally run together on the SIGMUS or
IncidentLens machine. The replay command can run there too, or on the storage
machine containing the collected files. `8766/tcp` is the only cross-machine
port required.

## Runtime and command count

| Part | How it runs | Routine command |
|---|---|---|
| Receiver | Docker container | `./docker-start up` |
| Enrichment | Docker container, started by the same wrapper | `./docker-start up` |
| Real replay sender | Host Python | `python -m replay.replay ...` |
| Synthetic replay sender | Host Python | `python -m replay.synthetic ...` |

After one-time setup, an end-to-end processing run takes **two commands**: one
Docker start on the compute machine and one Python replay command on the machine
with the input data. If the services are already running, only the replay
command is needed. The first Docker setup uses three commands below; the first
host-Python setup uses the four installation commands below.

## Start the receiver and enrichment service

Requirements: Docker with the Compose plugin, an OpenAI API key, and optionally
a Google Places API key for geocoding.

```bash
cp config.example.json config.json
chmod 600 config.json
./docker-start up
```

Set `enrichment.openai_api_key` in `config.json`. Set
`enrichment.google_places_api_key` if geocoding is wanted. The services run in
the background and append enriched records to the explicit
`receiver.output_path` JSONL file.

Useful commands:

```bash
./docker-start ps
./docker-start logs -f
./docker-start down
```

`config.json`, generated output, caches, and credentials are ignored by Git.

## Configuration

Start from `config.example.json`; only `config.json` is read at runtime.

| Setting | Meaning | Required change? |
|---|---|---|
| `paths.data_root` | Current Urban Observations data root. | For real replay |
| `paths.backup_root` | Root containing historical TAR archives. | For historical replay |
| `receiver.bind_host` | Host interface where Docker publishes the receiver port. Keep `127.0.0.1` for local-only access; use `0.0.0.0` only when trusted remote replay machines must connect. | Safe local default provided |
| `receiver.port` | Host port published for the receiver. | Safe default provided |
| `receiver.output_path` | Exact enriched JSONL file appended by the receiver. | Safe default provided |
| `receiver.max_message_bytes` | Maximum inline observation message size. | Safe default provided |
| `enrichment.openai_api_key` | OpenAI key for LLM/VLM enrichment. | Yes |
| `enrichment.google_places_api_key` | Google Places key for geocoding. | Optional |
| `enrichment.gpu` | `auto` uses NVIDIA acceleration when both the host GPU and Docker NVIDIA runtime are available; `true` requires it and `false` disables it. | `auto` |
| `enrichment.gpu_devices` | NVIDIA device IDs exposed to enrichment, or `all`. Inside the container PyTorch selects the first visible device. | `all` |
| `enrichment.pytorch_version` | PyTorch version installed in the processing image. | `2.7.1` |
| `enrichment.pytorch_index_url` | Official wheel channel; CUDA 11.8 is the broadly compatible NVIDIA default and can be replaced with `cpu` or another supported CUDA channel. | `https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118` |

CLIP automatically uses CUDA when a GPU is visible and otherwise falls back to
CPU. The launcher adds `compose.gpu.yaml` only on GPU-capable Docker hosts, so
the same configuration remains portable to CPU-only machines. Hugging Face
model downloads are cached under the persistent processing output directory.

The Compose stack also runs `live-replay`. At startup it baselines files already
present for the current day, then follows newly collected files from every
supported source. Each item is sent to `receiver` and acknowledged only after
enrichment and durable JSONL storage, so replay remains naturally backpressured.

When an enriched observation has coordinates but no natural-language location,
processing reverse-geocodes the coordinates with Google. SIGMUS retains the
resulting `formatted_address`, provider, and place ID on its `GeoEntity`; the
complete location annotation remains on `Data.annotations`.
| `enrichment.*_model` | Models used for text and images. | Safe defaults provided |
| `replay.receiver.host`, `replay.receiver.port` | Destination used by both real and synthetic replay. Use the receiver machine's reachable address, never `0.0.0.0`. | Change for separate machines |

The example contains placeholders only. It contains no working credentials.

The enriched stream keeps generic possible incident types in `incidents` for
IncidentLens. For real GDELT and synthetic news only, it also records
event-specific names in `news_incidents`; SIGMUS uses those names to originate
and link graph Incident nodes. Other modalities never originate SIGMUS
incidents.

The receiver and replay addresses have different network roles. The receiver
container listens internally on `0.0.0.0` so Docker can forward traffic to it;
that internal address is not a client destination. `receiver.bind_host`
controls which host interfaces publish the port, while `replay.receiver.host`
is the address replay clients connect to. For an all-local deployment both
operator-facing values should be `127.0.0.1`. For a remote sender, publish on a
trusted interface and configure the sender with the receiver machine's real IP
or DNS name.

## Install the replay commands

Replay reads existing files; it never changes or deletes collected data.

```bash
python3.10 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -e .
```

## Replay real data

Set `paths.data_root`, `paths.backup_root`, and the shared
`replay.receiver` endpoint in `config.json`. The end date is exclusive.

```bash
python -m replay.replay --from 2026-08-01 --to 2026-08-02
```

This reads current directories and historical TAR archives. To monitor new
files after replaying through yesterday, add `--follow` and omit `--to`.

## Replay completed simulator data

Pass the completed run or batch directory explicitly. Synthetic replay uses the
same `replay.receiver` endpoint and transport defaults as real replay.

```bash
python -m replay.synthetic /path/to/completed/batch
```

Keeping the dataset path on the command line makes each replay's input visible
and avoids accidentally reusing a stale experiment path from `config.json`.
The command shows an observation progress bar on stderr; each increment means
the receiver acknowledged that observation. Use `--no-progress` for logs or
non-interactive jobs that should omit the bar.
Less-common behavior remains available through CLI flags such as
`--no-recursive`, `--interval-seconds`, `--receiver-port`,
`--receiver-timeout`, `--receiver-retries`, `--output`, and
`--mapping-output`.

Both replay commands accept the same transport overrides:

```bash
--receiver-host HOST
--receiver-port PORT
--receiver-timeout SECONDS
--receiver-retries COUNT
--no-receiver
```

The former real-replay names (`--socket-host`, `--socket-port`, `--ack-timeout`,
`--network-retries`, and `--no-socket`) remain accepted as compatibility
aliases.

The simulator already chose the incident types, run counts, and number of
steps. Replay only reads the resulting files.
